Requirements for Conformance to ISO 14230-4.

I have a legal copy of ISO 14230-4.
Copyright law and the license that I agreed to prevent me from providing a copy
to anyone, however, the thing only has two pages of technical content.

This document then is my own, Requirements for Conformance to ISO 14230-4.

ISO 14230-4 is the fourth part of the Keyword Protocol 2000 specification,
titled "part 4: Requirements for emission-related systems".

It describes a subset of of the other ISO 14230 standards, a cut down version
if you like.

To the best of my knowledge ISO 14230-4 is "EOBD".  This is only part of KWP2000
that is mandatory on cars sold in Europe (specifically petrol powered cars since
2001 and diesel cars since I think 2003).

It enables a fault code reader to be designed with a simple cut down version of
KWP2000 as described in the other ISO 14230 standards (-1, -2, -3) which should
be able to read emissions related fault codes on all new European cars.

Here is what it says:-

ISO 14230-1 and ISO 9141-2 are essentially the same except that ISO 14230-1
mandates support for 24V systems.  Conformance to ISO 14230-4 does not require
support for 24V systems.

Optional length byte is not used.  Data length is limited to 7 bytes.

Request messages have bits A1A0 of format byte set to 11 with address
information and function addressing.

Response messages have bits A1A0 of format byte set to 10 with address
information and physical addressing.

Messages sent to the vehicle will use functional address 33H.

Target address of response will be the source address that was in the request
message.

Response messages will have the source address set to physical address of the
ECU.

Only normal timing with default values is supported.  Other timings specified
in ISO 14230-2 are not supported.

ECUs will support either 5 baud initialisation or fast initialisation.

Scantools must support both 5 baud initialisation and fast initialisation.

The ECU should only respond with keywords 2025, 2027, 2029 or 2031.  The
scantool only needs to support 2025 functionality which is three byte header,
no additional length byte and normal timing.

If 5 baud initialisation is used then the 5 baud address is 33H.

StopCommunication service is supported.

AccessTiming Parameter is not supported.

TesterPresent service will be supported; the scan tool can use TesterPresent
(within P3) or another method to keep communication active.

Emission related services are specified in ISO 15031-5.

Other diagnostic services are not required.

Negative responses must be one of:-
10 GeneralReject
11 ServiceNotSupported
12 SubFunctionNotSupported-InvalidFormat
21 Busy-RepeatRequest
22 ConditionsNotCorrect or RequestSequenceError
78 RequestCorrectlyReceived-ResponsePending

Negative repsonses with code 78 must be sent within P2, the ECU must follow
with a positive or negative response that is not code 78.

The scantool must ignore negative response messages, not perform ISO 14230-3
error handling, but instead wait for P2 timeout.
